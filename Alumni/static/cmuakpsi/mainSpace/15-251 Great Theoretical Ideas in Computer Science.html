<ul><li>Brenda: <span style="font-family: arial,sans,sans-serif;">good luck. do not take this class if you do not have to.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial,sans,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: arial,sans,sans-serif;">Miko: </span>The weekly assignments take an UNGODLY(!!!) number of hours to do, and the midterms/final are also extremely difficult. If you aren't a beast at discrete math such as myself, it is highly recommended that you take this course with a really really really smart roommate. (Raphael Kim is my hero.)</span><ul><li><span style="font-family: arial,sans,sans-serif;">Guruswami is able to teach the course's concepts really well and is very clear in his explanations.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial,sans,sans-serif;">Adamchik, on the other hand, is really hard to understand because of his accent, but you eventually get used to it.</span></li></ul></li><li><span style="font-family: arial,sans,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: arial,sans,sans-serif;">Jonathan: </span></span><span style="font-family: arial,sans,sans-serif;"><strong>Fall 251 is easier than spring one,</strong> but it's still very very hard. Definitely find good teammates; start hw early!!!; review for exams (they are not that hard if you sturdy regularly and understand each hw problem); keep your luck the whole semester!</span><ul><li><span style="font-family: arial,sans,sans-serif;">Ariel is really good at teaching and explaining, while I can't understand more than 40% of what Adamchik talked about due to his strong accent...</span></li></ul></li></ul><br />
