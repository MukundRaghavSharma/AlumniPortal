<ul><li>Chris: <span style="font-family: arial,sans,sans-serif;">Lenient grading, cheat sheets are allowed in tests, presentations play a big part in your overall grade, teaches material that deals more with the practical side of software engineering such as code release cycles and design principles, expects each student to have a solid grasp of programming so would not recommend without having taken both 15-211 and 15-213 (one of our week-long homework assignments was rewriting proxy lab)</span></li></ul><br />
