<span style="line-height: 1.5;">The Corporate Networking Dinner was first conceptualized by <a class="wiki_link" href="Hayden%20Tang.html">Hayden Tang</a> in the Fall of 2011. The idea was to host a networking event not being offered by Tepper, so that students would have an opportunity to get to know recruiters on a more personal level than they would during the career fairs. To time the event as strategically as possible, it was decided that the dinner should be held the night before the EOC, as that would be when there were the most recruiters looking for students to offer interviews to. The CND was not to be a recruiting event, but a more social networking event to allow students to find mentors, learn about companies, and build connections.</span><br />

Following the formulation of his general idea for the dinner, <a class="wiki_link" href="Hayden%20Tang.html">Hayden Tang</a> reached out to the brotherhood to recruit others to aid in the planning of the event. <a class="wiki_link" href="Nathaniel%20Eliason.html">Nathaniel Eliason</a> and <a class="wiki_link" href="Stefanie%20Chan.html">Stefanie Chan</a> agreed to co-head the event with Hayden, and took on a general committee of 15 brothers in specific committees: Financial Planning, PR, Corporate Outreach, Event Logistics, and Dinner Planning. The first dinner was held in the Singleton Room of Hammerschlag Hall, to accommodate the projected 60 students and 20 recruiters. Emails were sent out to all companies attending the EOC, and eventually 8 companies RSVP'd: <a class="wiki_link" href="Thoughtworks.html">Thoughtworks</a>, <a class="wiki_link" href="Rhiza.html">Rhiza</a>, <a class="wiki_link" href="Teach%20for%20America.html">Teach for America</a>, <a class="wiki_link" href="Nutanix.html">Nutanix</a>, <a class="wiki_link" href="VitecInc.html">VitecInc</a>, <a class="wiki_link" href="National%20Security%20Agency.html">National Security Agency</a>, <a class="wiki_link" href="Raytheon.html">Raytheon</a>, and <a class="wiki_link" href="MemSQL.html">MemSQL</a>.
