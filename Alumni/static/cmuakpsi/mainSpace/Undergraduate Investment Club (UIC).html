 The Undergraduate Investment Club is focused on bringing students who are interested in investing or trading together. By providing educational and practical resources, the Undergraduate Investment Club develops students' interests and knowledge in these fields. Regardless of personal experience, beginner or advanced, students will find opportunities that help further themselves in the areas of investing or trading. The Undergraduate Investment Club has something to offer to all students, from those interested in a career on Wall Street to those who just want to learn about personal portfolio management.<br />

<h1 id="toc1"><a name="Background"></a>Background</h1>
 The Carnegie Mellon Undergraduate Investment Club was started in September 2003 when a group of students came together with the common concern that there was no outlet for learning about the stock market at Carnegie Mellon. We met to discuss investment strategies, company outlooks, and the economy as a whole. As the group grew, we felt the need to be recognized by Student Senate so we would have the ability to reserve space on campus, become more eligible for funded-recognition, and to receive the other benefits that come with funded status. Following the recognition in April of 2004, we participated in the Activities Fair where there was a strong showing of interest from all colleges. We were invited to participate in the CMba Business Symposium where we also had a lot of interest. We were also invited to present our club to parents of students during Family Weekend at the Business Administration Academic Meeting. We spoke along with Dean Murphy and various business school administrators to the parents.<br />
