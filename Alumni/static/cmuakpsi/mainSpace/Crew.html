These include Brandeis University, Carnegie Mellon University, Case Western Reserve University, Emory University, New York University, University of Chicago, University of Rochester, and Washington University in St. Louis. However, as the team attends various regattas, other frequent competitors include University of Pittsburgh, Duquesne, Fordham, Lehigh, Penn State, and Duke. We cross hundreds more at large regattas.</span><br />
