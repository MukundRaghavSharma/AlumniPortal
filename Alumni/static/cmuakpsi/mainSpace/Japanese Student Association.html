 Japanese Student Association at Carnegie Mellon aims at providing Carnegie Mellon students, community and beyond with opportunities to experience the unique rich traditions and exciting modern cultures of Japan.<br />
<br />
Our events range from a big festival called &quot;Matsuri&quot; in the spring, to Japanese movie nights and learning traditional Japanese music. We hold on average one event per month for the public, and various events for those in the association, so stay updated! If you become a general body member, you will receive email notifications on events that we host, but you will have no obligation to attend or help at these events. We are a Japanese interest organization, so you do not have to be Japanese or speak Japanese at all.<br />
