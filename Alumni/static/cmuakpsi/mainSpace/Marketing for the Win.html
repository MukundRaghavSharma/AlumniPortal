 <hr />
Marketing for the Win is an enjoyable and (becoming) classic rush event. It combines teamwork, professional skills, and socializing into an event that allows brothers to assess rushees social and professional capacities while having some fun.<br />
<br />
Rushees are broken up into teams that usually sit at round tables with a few other brothers. Each team is given a random collection of items, and then has to come up with a product that combines those items together. Once the teams have come up with a product, they design a pitch for it which they will present as a team to a panel of judges made up of AKPsi brothers.<br />
<br />
The tables will usually receive an assortment of marketing information, on basic principles such as SWOT, 4Ps, etc. to help them shape their pitch. The judges assess them based on relevance to the audience, public speaking skills, quality of idea, team involvement in the pitch, and whatever else they deem relevant.<br />
