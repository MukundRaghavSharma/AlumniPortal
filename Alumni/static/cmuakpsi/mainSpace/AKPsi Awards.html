<h5 id="toc8"><a name="Brother of the Semester Award--Past Recipients--Hayden Tang, Fall 2010"></a><a class="wiki_link" href="Hayden%20Tang.html">Hayden Tang</a>, Fall 2010</h5>
 <span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #333333; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">Hayden Tang, one of our chapter's newest brothers, showed no lapse in his immediate involvement within the fraternity. He was able to identify several key weaknesses as Webmaster and then worked tirelessly to create a new photo galley, homepage, and FAQ section for the chapter website. More importantly, Hayden proved that being an exemplary professional often means being a good friend and a reliable brother. He went above and beyond semester event attendance requirements by creating even more opportunities for brothers to bond together. Hayden also attended many Executive Board meetings even though he was not required to do so, showing that his fraternal maturity and understanding goes far beyond his time in Alpha Kappa Psi.</span><br />
<br />
<h5 id="toc9"><a name="Brother of the Semester Award--Past Recipients--Daria Wong, Spring 2010"></a><a class="wiki_link" href="Daria%20Wong.html">Daria Wong</a>, Spring 2010</h5>
 <span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #333333; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">Daria stood out by combining her duties as Service chair with her knack for showing up to support the chapter at almost every single event that the fraternity held during the semester. Dedicated and persistent, she was frequently cited by the executive board as an example of a model brother due to her infectious enthusiasm and supportive personality. Brothers frequently counted on Daria for constructive criticism and suggestions about fraternity ideas and events. A two-time Phoenician Galley recipient, Daria greatly influenced the overall success of the Spring 2010 semester.</span><br />
<br />
<h5 id="toc10"><a name="Brother of the Semester Award--Past Recipients--Victoria Docherty, Fall 2009"></a><a class="wiki_link" href="Victoria%20Docherty.html">Victoria Docherty</a>, Fall 2009</h5>
 <span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #333333; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">Victoria managed to make a lasting impression on all brothers during her term as Service chair. Under her direction, brothers improved their dedication to our core values, which was emphatically proven by the fact that more total service hours were completed during the fall than last year's total count. To top off an impressive semester, Victoria took extraordinary initiative in establishing a successful campus-wide service event, the Tepper Giving Tree, which our chapter hopes will become an annual tradition. Overall, Victoria was also an elite all-around contributor to our chapter in many other ways, including an aggressive pursuit of our fraternity's best interests as head of the housing committee.</span><br />
<br />
<h5 id="toc11"><a name="Brother of the Semester Award--Past Recipients--Suraj Baxi, Spring 2009"></a><a class="wiki_link" href="Suraj%20Baxi.html">Suraj Baxi</a>, Spring 2009</h5>
 <span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #333333; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">Suraj won this award for a very different reason than the previous two Ôfirst semester as a brotherÕ winners (Victor and Ji Soo). Unlike Victor and Ji Soo, he did not hold a position within the fraternity. Although he did contribute greatly as a member of the professional committee, it was the effort above and beyond his duties that truly impressed. Two examples of this were the ice scream social event he planned with other campus organizations and the presentation body language workshop he gave to the Iota Class. The fraternity pride and enthusiasm of the always energetic Suraj was definitely felt by all and played a large part in earning him this recognition as well.</span><br />
<br />
<h5 id="toc12"><a name="Brother of the Semester Award--Past Recipients--Danielle Rosenfeld, Fall 2008"></a><a class="wiki_link" href="Danielle%20Rosenfeld.html">Danielle Rosenfeld</a>, Fall 2008</h5>
 <span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #333333; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">Danielle was elected as the chapter's first ever Fundraising Chair and far exceeded even the biggest expectations for the position. Her enthusiasm for fundraising was contagious and the constant flow of fundraising events and opportunities made her first semester a successful one. Continuing this effort into the spring, Danielle once again proved to be a fundraising force, leaving the fraternity wishing she was not studying abroad this year preventing her from retaining the position that has been synonymous with her name.</span><br />
<br />
<h5 id="toc13"><a name="Brother of the Semester Award--Past Recipients--Jay Khil, Spring 2008"></a><a class="wiki_link" href="Jay%20Khil.html">Jay Khil</a>, Spring 2008</h5>
 <span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #333333; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">While most seniors like to coast through their second semester of senior year and enjoy what the fraternity can give back to them, Jay did just the opposite. Although she held no position, she was the most active member of the social committee and proved to be a great help to and supporter of the social chair. She played a major role in planning such events as the fraternity ski trip and a popular end of the semester fraternity feast. Jay also attended far more events than were required; another example of her dedication and contribution to the fraternity throughout her senior year.</span><br />
<br />
<h5 id="toc14"><a name="Brother of the Semester Award--Past Recipients--Ji Soo Hong, Fall 2007"></a><a class="wiki_link" href="Ji%20Soo%20Hong.html">Ji Soo Hong</a>, Fall 2007</h5>
 <span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #333333; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">Ji Soo was elected Faculty Relations Chair in her first semester after crossing. She went above and beyond the role, expanding the position beyond what any other Faculty Relations Chair had done before. Ji Soo reconnected the chapter with its valued faculty brothers through her persistence and diligence in keeping close contact with them. She also organized a number of events centered round getting to know our faculty brothers better, including the first of the now annual brunch at Dr. Milton Cofield's home.</span><br />
<br />
<h5 id="toc15"><a name="Brother of the Semester Award--Past Recipients--Victor Tam, Spring 2007"></a><a class="wiki_link" href="Victor%20Tam.html">Victor Tam</a>, Spring 2007</h5>
 <span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #333333; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">Elected to the position of Public Relations Chair in his first semester as a brother, Victor quickly had to assume of much larger role. Beyond the usual PR duties, he was tasked with handling a majority of the planning and organizing of rush events only a couple months after he himself had become a brother. Victor handled the added responsibility well and led a very successful Epsilon rush.</span><br />

 <hr />
The Casper Award was created by Vice President of Pledging <a class="wiki_link" href="Sean%20Kim.html">Sean Kim</a> during the fall of 2011.
