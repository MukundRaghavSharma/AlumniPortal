 <hr />
The Pledge Action Plan details the guidelines by which a pledge is to be disciplined <span style="line-height: 1.5;">and evaluated at all times during the pledging process. A pledge can only be removed from the process if this procedure is followed unless under critical circumstances (i.e. sexual harassment, cheating, illegal activity, etc.). Under this system, all warnings to pledges for underperformance or failure to meet expectations of any kind will be delivered in writing. When delivered, the Vice President of Pledging and the pledge being addressed must be present, but the president and the pledge’s big brother must have signed the document prior to the meeting.</span><br />
<br />
A resolution/strategy, determined by the Vice President of Pledging, is the criteria by <span style="line-height: 1.5;">which the pledge’s response to the issue being addressed will be evaluated. The Vice President of Pledging will also set a re-evaluation date that is to fall no earlier than one week and no later than three weeks from the date the written warning is handed out. On that date, the brotherhood will open discussion on the pledge to judge whether or not the goals laid out in the Pledge Action Plan have been sufficiently met and thus whether the pledge deserves to continue in the process. The discussion is to take place at the most immediate designated evaluation point in the pledge process (i.e. midcourt or mini-court) unless the nearest event falls within one week of the warning.</span><br />
<br />
To be considered valid, the written warning must contain the following information: <span style="line-height: 1.5;">date addressed, pledge name, addressed by, issue, resolution/strategy, re-evaluation date, potential consequences, pledge signature, witness signatures, and date closed (with Vice President of Pledging signature). The Vice President of Pledging may reference the document at the end of these bylaws for a guideline of how the Pledge Action Plan warning may be formatted.</span><br />

 <ul><li>Is all written feedback a PAP?</li><li>Should everyone get a PAP?</li><li>Can we drop someone without a PAP? (has been done in the past, but seems in conflict with the bylaw)</li><li>Does this conflict with our national bylaws? (which say that we can drop any pledge at any time)</li></ul><br />

The Pledge Action Plan details the guidelines by which a pledge is to be disciplined <span style="line-height: 1.5;">and evaluated at all times during the pledging process. A pledge can only be removed from the process if this procedure is followed unless under critical circumstances (i.e. sexual harassment, cheating, illegal activity, etc.). Under this system, all warnings to a pledge for underperformance or failure to meet expectations of any kind will be delivered in a PAP in case one is issued or in a separate document. The Vice President of Pledging has the right to deliver a PAP to a pledge at time during the pledge process. The brotherhood too may decide to issue a PAP. Upon request of any member, a discussion may be held, and a PAP may be issued to a pledge with at least twenty-five percent (25%) votes of the quorum present. When the PAP is delivered, the Vice President of Pledging and the pledge being addressed must be present, but the president and the pledge’s big brother must have signed the document prior to the meeting.</span><br />

 <hr />
<ul><li>Brothers can now vote to give a pledge a PAP with a 25% (of present brothers) vote in favor of the PAP. This is meant to be reflective of the 25% of active brothers required to drop a pledge.</li><li>Language in the bylaw was clarified to show that pledges can receive written feedback without it necessarily being a PAP.</li></ul>
