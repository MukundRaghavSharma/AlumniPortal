<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: sans-serif;">In the Summer of 2003, five Carnegie Mellon students independently considered founding an organization which would transcend typical campus clubs and also support the undergraduate business community.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: sans-serif;"><strong>Ellen Lai</strong>, a Junior in Business Administration, found Alpha Kappa Psi to be what she was looking for after doing research on business-related Greek organizations. <strong>Malcolm Ong</strong>, a Junior in Business Administration and Computer Science, was inspired by and introduced to the chapter at the University of Southern California (Alpha Zeta Chapter). <strong>Patrick Cao</strong>, a Sophomore in Business Administration, was also sold on the idea and later joined Malcolm. <strong>James Chen</strong> and <strong>Michael Yang</strong>, Sophomores in Business Administration, had learned of Alpha Kappa Psi from their friends from other college campuses.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: sans-serif;">After coming back to school in the Fall semester, all three separate interest groups discovered each others’ similar ambitions and objectives, and hence merged into one unified group. They proceeded to contact Mr. Brian D. Parker, Alpha Kappa Psi’s Senior Director of Finance and Expansion, Ms. Pam Miksell, the Eastern Regional Director, Mr. Brendan P. Sherry, the Eastern Sectional Director, and the University of Pittsburgh (Delta Chapter) to inquire about the process of chartering a chapter at Carnegie Mellon. Dr. Milton Cofield, Carnegie Mellon’s Undergraduate Business Director, was also approached about the idea and was invited to serve as the colony’s faculty advisor.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: sans-serif;">After conducting an initial Rush for the interest group during the first few weeks of the Spring 2004 semester, the Alpha Kappa Psi Carnegie Mellon Colony was inducted on February 17th, 2004 with 38 colony initiates. The following 10 weeks took its toll, reducing the class to 21 colony initiates. However, with the hard work and dedication of the actives, the Colony successfully accomplished several events: professional – a Senior Wall Street Panel; service – Boys and Girls Club; and Family House; fundraiser – sponsored by Rita’s Italian Ice; and a couple social events.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: sans-serif;">As the journey continued into the Fall semester, another Rush was conducted to recruit additional members for the Colony. Thus, on September 19, 2004, additional colonists were inducted, bringing the Colony roster to a total of 43. For the next 9 weeks, the Colony accomplished many more successful events: professional – speaker Prof. Sukits of University of Pittsburgh on i-banking, and speaker Stephen Wayhart on marketing/branding; service – Boys and Girls Club Halloween Festival; fundraiser – poker tournament; and various social events.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: sans-serif;">After a long and struggling journey, the Colony completed the process on December 9th, 2004, and took the final step into the threshold of brotherhood on January 15th, 2005 to be the Omega Psi Chapter of Alpha Kappa Psi with a total of 38 brothers.</span>
