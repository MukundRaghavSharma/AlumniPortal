SRA International is a Government IT consulting firm located in Fair Lakes Virginia, 30 minutes south of Washington D.C. They historically recruit at the Fall and Spring EOC, and look for students of all major. They do not recruit for specific positions, but rather tailor internships to the individual in order to offer them the best experience. In addition to not discriminating by major, they do not discriminate by year, and will take Freshmen through Seniors. <br />

SRA's intern policy is to take the best minds they can find and then allow their interns to specify areas they would be interested in working in. Because of this, you generally do not interview for a specific position, but will rather be asked what positions you would be interested in were you to receive an offer. Typical internship possibilities include:<br />
<ul><li>Market Intelligence</li><li>Internal Finance</li><li>Database Management</li><li>Organizational Change Management</li></ul><br />
