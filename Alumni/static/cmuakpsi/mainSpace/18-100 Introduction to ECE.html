<ul><li><span style="font-family: arial,sans,sans-serif;"><u>Abhishek</u>: The lectures are really dull and almost impossible to pay attention in with Sullivan's accent. Labs and Homeworks are graded very leniently. Final is challenging!</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial,sans,sans-serif;"><u>Chris</u>: Tough material at first, but then the last third dealing with logic gates is super easy. Test average was around 75, 50, 90 for the three exams, but you get to <strong>drop your lowest exam, lowest homework, and on top of that labs are a big grade booster</strong>, so you end up with a much better grade than you thought you would get.</span></li></ul><br />
