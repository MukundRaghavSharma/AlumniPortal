For the Basics of Business event, brothers started by giving interactive talks on different major areas of business (Finance, Consulting, Trading, Design, Marketing) where they would describe their experiences in their internships and open themselves for questions along the way. After the discussion section was over, there were tables arranged around the UC with tags on them with different company names that brothers would stand by based on where they'd interned. Rushees could ask about the company, brothers' experiences there, how to best get an interview, etc.
