The push for Corporate Sponsorship was started in the Summer of 2011, led by <a class="wiki_link" href="Hayden%20Tang.html">Hayden Tang</a> and <a class="wiki_link" href="Bernard%20Yuan.html">Bernard Yuan</a>.<br />

Back in 2011, thanks to the reference of alumnus <a class="wiki_link" href="Michael%20Lu.html">Michael Lu</a>, we first connected with <a class="wiki_link" href="Capital%20One.html">Capital One</a>. We presented Capital One with how Alpha Kappa Psi could help to strengthen the presence of Capital One on Carnegie Mellon's campus, and Capital One has been our sponsor ever since. In the Fall of 2012, we renewed our contract with Capital One, and continue promoting their image on campus.<br />

A new initiative started in the Spring of 2013, <a class="wiki_link" href="Intern%20Sushi.html">Intern Sushi</a> offers a promotional opportunity for student organizations looking to raise money. By promoting their website, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.internsushi.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">www.internsushi.com</a>, and helping students to register for it, we earn money for Alpha Kappa Psi. At 2$ per registration, our aim was to raise at least 500$ of our 5000$ Spring fundraising goal through Intern Sushi. Alpha Kappa Psi discovered the Intern Sushi opportunity as a result of alumnus <a class="wiki_link" href="Kunal%20Natu.html">Kunal Natu</a> having interned there in the past.
