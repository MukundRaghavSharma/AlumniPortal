 Phil Contactos, the head of the Contacos Wealth Management Group at Wells Fargo, spoke to us about the field of finance. He started off by covering the basic ideas and principles that many people hear but don’t fully understand. He engaged the audience by asking several questions about current events and our perspective on different issues. Later, he discussed in greater details his responsibilities for his job on a day to day basis. He talked about different clients and the kinds of services he provides them to help them manage their money.<br />

 Position: Developer at Songwhale<br />
Contact info: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="mailto:jasong@songwhale.com" rel="nofollow">jasong@songwhale.com</a><br />
Topic: Jason gave us a presentation about how Songwhale works and how they developed a business plan. It is a digital content delivery service that teams up with big companies (Steelers, Pirates, Gatorade, Nike, Pizza Hut etc) to offer promotions that aim to make events more interactive. He set up a demonstration promotion for our event. Each brother in attendance texted CMU to WHALE and received a message in return. Two brothers won prizes just as someone might win in a real promotion. Songwhale was started only a few years ago and has been expanding rapidly ever since. The entire staff is pretty young and really enthusiastic about what they do.<br />
