 Founded on February 17, 1944 at Carnegie Mellon University, the Delta Xi chapter has now grown to more than 95 sisters and hundreds of alumni.<br />
<br />
Mission- Aspire to Be. Through philanthropy and service, scholarship, and leadership, we believe that each sister of encompasses the values of sisterhood, friendship, and self-growth. Along with Kappa, many of our sisters are heavily involved on the CMU campus and Pittsburgh communities.<br />
<br />
This year, Delta Xi was proud to accept the Chapter of the Year award from the Carnegie Mellon Greek Life office, as well as an award for Outstanding Recruitment Initiatives. Two of our members received individual awards for Greek Athlete of the Year and Greek Award of Distinction.<br />
