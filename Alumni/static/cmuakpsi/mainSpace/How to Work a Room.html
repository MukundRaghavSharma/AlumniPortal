The &quot;How to Work a Room&quot; is in many ways the &quot;ultimate&quot; professional rush event. It allows rushees to get a quick sampling of the different aspects of professionalism that will be covered in pledging, while also allowing them to show confidence (through speaking) insight (though analysis of resumes/emails/etc.) intellect (through brainteasers) and socialize with brothers.<br />
<br />
How to Work a Room has been done a few different ways, but the format is most frequently a large room with a number of different stations positioned around it. Rushees move from station to station throughout the event, so that they get to experience each aspect. In the past, some of the stations have been:<br />
<ul><li>Public Speaking<ul><li>The public speaking station is typically impromptu speeches. A brother who has strong speaking skills will demonstrate how to do a proper impromptu speech, and then each rushee will have a minute to do one of their own based on a topic of the brother's choosing. This can be useful to see who is confident enough to get up and give a speech.</li></ul></li><li>Resume analysis<ul><li>Brothers will donate resumes for rushees to analyze. Some of the resumes may also have things changed about them to make them sub-optimal, and brothers will ask the rushees to provide feedback on things that work/don't work. It's useful for letting rushees get some practice critiquing resumes, as well as for seeing resumes that are strong.</li></ul></li><li>Email analysis<ul><li>Rushees analyze emails based on their professionalism</li></ul></li><li>Brainteasers</li><li>Networking<ul><li>This was a station during the Pi Process rush. Brothers <a class="wiki_link" href="Hayden%20Tang.html">Hayden Tang</a> and <a class="wiki_link" href="Nathaniel%20Eliason.html">Nathaniel Eliason</a> gave a tag-team talk on succeeding at job fairs, over emails, cold calling, and at networking events. They discussed the importance of getting business cards, sending follow up emails, having good questions to ask, and connecting with recruiters.</li></ul></li></ul>
