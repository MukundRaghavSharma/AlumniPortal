<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;">The primary duties of the Master of Rituals are to:</span><span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><br />
<ol><li>Run our fraternity rituals throughout the semester</li><li>Run deliberations and discussions during rituals and general body meetings</li><li>Count votes along with the President and Warden</li></ol><br />
In the course of these responsibilities, they're expected to remain an objective judge, traditionally not speaking during discussions unless asked for information, and not voting. In the event of a tie the MOR and the President have the right to vote in order to attempt to break the tie, but they are not required to exercise that right.<br />

<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;">Up until Spring of 2014 deliberations and discussions were run based on an adapted version of Robert's Rules. In the Spring of 2014, MOR Jay Chopra ran a number of experiments to try running deliberations in different ways that might be more effective. Following the four experiments, a new method of discussion was arrived at.</span><span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><br />
</span><span style="display: block; text-align: justify;">This new method was implemented by Jay's successor, Nathaniel Eliason, based on the following rules:</span><span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><br />
<ul><li>For voting, each candidate will be discussed individually and then the candidates will be compared. Moving to open is not necessary</li><li>A brother may move to close whenever they feel a candidate has been fully discussed<ul><li>A brother may object to closing, and if they have a &quot;second&quot; then discussion will resume with new information until there is another move to close</li></ul></li><li>Each brother may only speak once per discussion, unless they're responding to a request for information<ul><li>A discussion is anything leading up to a &quot;move to close.&quot; So in the event of an election between two people, you could speak once during the discussion of the first candidate, once during the discussion of the second, and once during the comparison</li></ul></li><li>A queue system will be used to keep track of who should be speaking next<ul><li>This queue is managed by the Secretary and is projected behind the MOR while he or she is running discussion</li></ul></li><li>A sub-queue will be used for tracking responses to requests for information<ul><li>Brothers may join the sub-queue by raising two fingers instead of their whole hand</li></ul></li><li>Brothers are not required to lead the discussion with a &quot;pro-con-pro,&quot; they may instead share any information they please<ul><li>If discussion does not immediately start, the MOR can ask for leading questions such as &quot;Does anyone have a pro?&quot;</li></ul></li><li>Brothers who have to be &quot;hushed&quot; more than once will be relocated to a different part of the room<ul><li>Further hushing will result in removal from the deliberation, and the associated fines</li></ul></li></ul></span><br />

<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;">The MOR is required to keep track of all ritual materials, usually stored in the &quot;ritual bin.&quot; They are also expected to purchase new pledge and brother pins should we begin running low.</span><br />
