The Corporate Networking Dinner Chair was established in the Spring of 2012 in order to dedicate a fraternity position to the successful planning and hosting of the <a class="wiki_link" href="Corporate%20Networking%20Dinner.html">Corporate Networking Dinner</a>. Following the first CND, the brotherhood agreed that it was a sufficiently large task that it justified not just being part of the <a class="wiki_link" href="Corporate%20Sponsorship%20Chair.html">Corporate Sponsorship Chair</a> role, and receive a chair of its own. The first person to hold the position was <a class="wiki_link" href="Stefanie%20Chan.html">Stefanie Chan</a> who was awarded the position for her dedication to seeing the first CND come to fruition. The duties of the position include planning the dinner, reaching out to companies to attend, PRing to students to attend, and ensuring that the brotherhood comes together to represent their fraternity as strongly as possible during this flagship event.<br />

Due to the difficult nature of the role, and the degree of background knowledge required in order to be successful, it was decided that the chair should be appointed by the previous holder of the position along with the president. This appointing would be based on the individual's involvement in helping to plan the upcoming CND, and the individual would be chosen in the weeks leading up to the CND planned by the previous chair. This new appointee would then serve as an apprentice to the current chair, in order to be involved on all the finally planning aspects, in order to be best positioned to take over the role for the next dinner.<br />
