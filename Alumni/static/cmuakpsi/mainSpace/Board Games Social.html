<strong><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 12pt;">Event recap</span></strong><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 12pt;">: Since the weather was terrible, BBQ was cancelled. Instead, we played scrabble, scattegories, banangrams, uno, mafia, and later, frisbee and soccer with rushees and brothers. </span><br />

<span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Potential improvements</strong>: Maybe have people break up into smaller groups and play games. It seems like some people were just standing around, and if we put them into groups, it would have been better. </span>
